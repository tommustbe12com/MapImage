# MapImage
A useful plugin for utility/moderation purposes that allows you to create a map corresponding to any image URL. Server needs internet on each startup for this to work, and needs to be able to access the image URL every time it starts.

## Usage
/mapimage <image> lets you get the map with the image being the image URL of your choice. Include https://, or it will not work.

## Perms
`mapimage.use` is default to op, and corresponds to the /mapimage command. Using luckperms or another permissions updater you can change this, or just change the default in the source code and build.
